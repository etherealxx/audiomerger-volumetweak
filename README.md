# audiomerger-volumetweak
(Tk GUI) Merge 2 audio tracks within a single video file, while customizing the 2nd track's volume before merging.

used personally for my [youtube alt account](https://www.youtube.com/@etherealcrossplay), where i record gameplay video with obs, and my voice (on the 2nd audio track) is a bit loud. 

ffmpeg.exe must exist on the script's directory.

The `preview current volume` feature will calculate which 10 seconds part of the video has the loudest voice (on the 2nd audio track), and then showing preview of combined audio on that specific part.
